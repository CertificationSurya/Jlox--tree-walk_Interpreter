# Jlox (*.jlox)

Jlox is a dynamic, Object Oriented Programming language implemented in Java, designed to serve as a practical learning tool for understanding interpreter and compiler development concepts. Inspired by Bob Nystrom's insightful book, ["Crafting Interpreters"](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), this version of Jlox employs a bytecode virtual machine.

## Overview

Jlox was developed as a hands-on project to deepen comprehension of interpreter and compiler principles outlined in Bob Nystrom's book. It serves as a practical exploration into the complexities of language design, parsing, and execution.

## Features

- OOP features like: inheritance, polymorphism and so on.
- Supports curry functions, ternary operator, takes Input from Users
- Also supports REPL functionality.

## Key Resources

- [Bob Nystrom](https://stuffwithstuff.com/)'s book, ["Crafting Interpreters"](https://craftinginterpreters.com/): Provides invaluable guidance on creating programming language interpreters and compilers.

## Getting Started

To test any of the jlox scripts follow these steps.

```
$ cd Jlox--tree-walk_Interpreter
$ make run
